To fix:
- implement better error handling (for both client and server)
- find better solution for file storage proccess
- some files cannot be uploaded (503 error)
- reduce the gif size for video preview (it takes too long to load preview on hover)
- get rid of pixels on the generated gif
- make video player downloads only needed chunk of the file instead of waiting to download the whole file
- video player could have more features
- video could have more quality versions
